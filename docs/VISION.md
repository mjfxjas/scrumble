# Vision

Scenic City Rumble is a Chattanooga-first, human-curated matchup app. It shows the best 1v1 faceoffs for local spots and lets people pick a favorite in seconds.

## Core promise
- Two entries enter, one wins
- Fast, opinionated picks
- Local, not touristy

## Target audience
- 18-40 locals who want cool, current recs
- Friends making quick plans
- Light family use, but not a family-first brand

## Differentiators
- Curated matchups, not a directory
- Vibe-first copy, no corporate fluff
- Short lists people can trust
