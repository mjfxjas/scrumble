# MVP Scope

## Must-have
- Single matchup view with two entries
- Vote button per entry
- Live-ish counter (polling or realtime later)
- Simple share link

## Nice-to-have
- Daily featured matchup
- Past winners list
- Category tags (food, music, outdoors)
- Basic anti-spam (rate limit / IP / session)

## Out of scope (MVP)
- User accounts
- Reviews at scale
- Full directory or search
- Complex moderation tooling
